# LeetCode Solutions YouTube Automator

This project automates the creation and management of a YouTube channel dedicated to posting LeetCode problem solutions. The system handles the entire workflow from selecting problems to publishing finished videos without manual intervention.

## Project Overview

The LeetCode Solutions YouTube Automator creates and publishes educational coding videos by:
1. Scraping LeetCode problems
2. Generating optimal solutions
3. Creating video content with explanations
4. Handling YouTube uploads and SEO

## Key Features

- **Automated Problem Selection**: Intelligent algorithm to select trending or relevant LeetCode problems
- **Solution Generation**: Creates efficient code solutions with time/space complexity analysis
- **Video Production**: Generates video content with:
    - Problem explanation
    - Solution walkthrough
    - Code visualization
    - Time and space complexity analysis
- **Channel Management**: Handles uploads, descriptions, tags, thumbnails, and audience engagement
